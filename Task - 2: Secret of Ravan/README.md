# Task - 2: Secret of Ravan

## Challenge Description
Ram discovers that Ravan has a single weakness, and to defeat him, Ram needs to know this weakness.<br />
Ram learns that the secret to Ravan's weakness is hidden in a locked box, which can only be opened with a special password.<br />
Vibhishan knows that the password is a combination of 8 characters that include numbers, letters and special characters, but he only knows 6 of them.<br />
Can you find the password through brute force so that Ram can open the box?<br />
Write a Python program for brute-forcing.

#### Instructions -
- The locked box is provided as a zipped folder named `The_secret.zip`. (Use the pyzipper library in Python to extract it)
- Some of the code for the brute force program is already provided in the Python file named `Task - 02.py`.
- Submit the commented code, the extracted file containing the hint, and a README file explaining the approach. (Note: The explanation carries significant weightage.)
##### Solution 
Downloaded the zipped folder `The_secret.zip` from the repository.
Installed pyzipper in linux
    pip install pyzipper
